2. **View Expenses**:  
   Displays all logged expenses in an easy-to-read format. Ensures only complete entries are shown for consistency.

3. **Budget Tracking**:  
   Set a monthly budget and monitor your expenses. Provides warnings if you exceed your budget or displays the remaining balance.

4. **File Handling**:  
   Save expenses to a CSV file for persistence and load them back when restarting the program.

5. **Interactive Menu**:  
   Navigate through the program with a user-friendly menu to add expenses, track budgets, save data, and more.

## Future Enhancements
